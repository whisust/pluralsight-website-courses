            <h2>Our history</h2>
            <p>
                For many years, <b>Bethany</b> has been baking the most delicious pies at her home. In 2013, we opened
                our
                first
                store in <i>Brussels (Belgium)</i> in a cosy little street near the Grand Market. People from all over
                the
                world
                fell in
                love
                with the soft cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies... The store became a success in no time.
                <br/>In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Beth ow looking at the result of this: our
                very
                own
                webstore, making it possible to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you feel like it!
            </p>
            <p>
                Bethany is famous for using only the best ingredients. This way, we can make sure that our pies are
                absolutely
                the
                best.
