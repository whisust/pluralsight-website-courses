    <h1>Welcome to Bethany's Pie Shop</h1>
    <h2>Our history</h2>
    <p>
        For many years, <b>Bethany</b> has been baking the most delicious pies at her home. In 2013, we opened our first
        store in <i>Brussels (Belgium)</i> in a cosy little street near the Grand Market. People from all over the world
        fell in
        love
        with the soft cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies... The store became a success in no time.
        <br/>In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Beth ow looking at the result of this: our very own
        webstore, making it possible to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you feel like it!
    </p>
    <p>
        Bethany is famous for using only the best ingredients. This way, we can make sure that our pies are absolutely
        the
        best.
