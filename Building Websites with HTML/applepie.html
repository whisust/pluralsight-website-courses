                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Bethany received the recipe for this delicious apple pie from her grandmother. At the age of 5, she
                    was already baking this.
                    <em>all-American traditional apple</em> pie at her home.
                    As the recipe goes a long way back, it contains the most typical ingredients used for so many years
                    to make this classic even today one of our most popular pies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This pie is available <strong>every day</strong> and comes in 2 sizes.
                    <span class="pie-product__cooking-indications">You can serve it cold or warm it for 4 minutes in the microwave to give it an extra touch. </span>
                    Your house will smell just like Bethany's Shop!

                <h2>How we make this pie</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        First, we combine sugar, flour and spices. We toss the apples with some lemon juice and ad sugar.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We then create the bottom crust and fill that with apple mixture. We put some butter on that.
                        We then roll remaining crust to fit top of pie.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then we beat the eggs white until we have a foamy mix.
                        That is then brushed over the crust. We sprinkle some extra sugar.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then the pie goes into the oven at 360Â° for 35 minutes. When ready, we let it cool on a wire rack.
                    </li>
                </ol>
